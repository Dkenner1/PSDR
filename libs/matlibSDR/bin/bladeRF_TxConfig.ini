#Frequency: Range (47MHz, 6GHz)
freq=496500000
#Bandwidth: Range (200KHz, 56MHz)
bandwidth=200000

# Number of samples to be sampled. Determines transmission length
# Transmit time = num_samples/sampleRate
num_samples=500000
# Sample Rate, Range (521000, 61440000)

#pwr: Range (0, 100) inclusive
pwr=42.5

# Gain mode: (decoupled, coupled)
# In coupled mode the pwr scale will vary gain and signal amplitude together
# with a gain range of [0, 66]
# When in decoupled mode so gain can be set individually with range [-44, 66]
# Set to decoupled mode if you need negative gain or want control of gain specifically
gain_mode=coupled

# Gain: Only used when power_mode is decoupled
gain=26

#String settings
#tx_mode: [ continuous, pulse ]
tx_mode=continuous

#channel modes: (single, mimo)
channel_mode=single

#channels: 1, 2 (in mimo mode setting is irrevelant)
channel=1
#duty_cycle: percent of period signal is off, only used in pulse mode, (range 0-100)
duty_cycle=51.0

#Tx Enable: C script checks this value to determine whether or not to continue transmitting
